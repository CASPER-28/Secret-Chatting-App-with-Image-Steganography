# Secret-Chatting-App-with-Image-Steganography
This project is a Secret Chatting App that allows users to securely encode and decode secret messages within images using LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography. The app leverages encryption to protect the confidentiality of the messages, ensuring that only authorized users can decode them.

Features:

1-Upload an image to hide messages.

2-Encrypt messages with a user-defined password.

3-Compress messages before embedding to optimize storage.

4-Real-time character counter to prevent message overflow.

5-User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
